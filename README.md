## CGM Display

# Overview
  This is a simple iOS app that uses WebView along with a local HTML page to fetch data from my Dexcom glucose monitor using the <a href="https://github.com/brettfarrow/cgm.js">cgm.js</a> library and display it with the <a href="https://www.chartjs.org">chart.js library</a>
